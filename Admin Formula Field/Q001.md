## 4) Case – Phone Must Be 10 Digits When Provided

Create a Case validation rule that requires the **Contact Phone** field to have exactly 10 digits (no validation on formatting, just numeric count) when it is filled.

- Object: Case
- Field: Contact Phone (`ContactPhone`)
- Rule Name: `CASE004_Phone_10_Digits`
- Description: Force Contact Phone to contain exactly 10 digits when entered.
- Requirement: If `ContactPhone` is **not blank**, the number of digits (after removing spaces and dashes) must be **exactly 10**.
- Hint: Use `SUBSTITUTE`, `LEN`, `ISBLANK`, `NOT`.
- Error Message: `Contact Phone must contain exactly 10 digits [CASE004]`
- Error Location: `Contact Phone`

## 5) Case – Internal Case Code Not Allowed for External Cases

Create a Case validation rule that prevents entering **Internal Case Code** for cases marked as **External**.

- Object: Case
- Field: Internal Case Code (`Internal_Case_Code__c`)
- Field: Case Type (`Type` picklist with value `"External"`)
- Rule Name: `CASE005_Internal_Code_External_Case`
- Description: Block Internal Case Code for external cases.
- Requirement: If `Type = "External"`, then `Internal_Case_Code__c` must be **blank**.
- Hint: Use `ISPICKVAL`, `NOT`, `ISBLANK`.
- Error Message: `Internal Case Code cannot be populated for External cases [CASE005]`
- Error Location: `Internal Case Code`

---

## 6) Case – Closed Case Must Have Resolution

Create a Case validation rule that requires **Resolution** to be filled when Case Status is **Closed**.

- Object: Case
- Field: Status (`Status`)
- Field: Resolution (`Resolution__c`)
- Rule Name: `CASE006_Resolution_Required_On_Close`
- Description: Ensure Resolution is provided when closing a Case.
- Requirement: If `Status = "Closed"`, then `Resolution__c` must be **not blank**.
- Hint: Use `ISPICKVAL`, `ISBLANK`.
- Error Message: `Resolution is required when closing a Case [CASE006]`
- Error Location: `Resolution`

---

## 7) Case – High Priority Must Have Engineering Req

Create a Case validation rule that enforces that **Engineering Req Number** is filled in for **High** priority cases.

- Object: Case
- Field: Priority (`Priority`)
- Field: Engineering Req Number (`EngineeringReqNumber__c`)
- Rule Name: `CASE007_EngReq_Required_High_Priority`
- Description: Ensure Engineering Req Number is provided for high-priority issues.
- Requirement: If `Priority = "High"`, then `EngineeringReqNumber__c` must be **not blank**.
- Hint: Use `ISPICKVAL`, `ISBLANK`.
- Error Message: `Engineering Req Number is required for High priority cases [CASE007]`
- Error Location: `Engineering Req Number`

---

## 8) (Advanced) Case – Engineering Req Must Be Numeric and Fixed Length

Create an advanced Case validation rule to enforce both numeric and length constraints on Engineering Req Number.

- Object: Case
- Field: Engineering Req Number (`EngineeringReqNumber__c`)
- Rule Name: `CASE008_EngReq_Numeric_And_Length`
- Description: Engineering Req Number must be numeric and exactly 8 digits when provided.
- Requirement:

  - If `EngineeringReqNumber__c` is **not blank**:

    - It must be **numeric**
    - It must be **exactly 8 digits long**

- Hint: Use `ISNUMBER`, `LEN`, `NOT`, `ISBLANK`.
- Error Message: `Engineering Req Number must be numeric and exactly 8 digits [CASE008]`
- Error Location: `Engineering Req Number`

---

## 9) (Advanced) Case – Custom Field Code Pattern with REGEX

Create a Case validation rule that enforces a specific **pattern** for the **Engineering Req Number** field using REGEX.
reate a Case val

- Object: Case
- Field: Engineering Req Number (`EngineeringReqNumber__c`)
- Rule Name: `CASE009_EngReq_Regex_Validation`
- Description: Enforce Engineering Req Number pattern as `ER-` followed by exactly 5 digits (example: `ER-12345`).
- Requirement:

  - If `EngineeringReqNumber__c` is **not blank**, it must match the pattern `ER-12345` (ER-, then 5 digits).

- Hint: Use `REGEX`, `ISBLANK`, `NOT`.
- Error Message: `Engineering Req Number must be in format 'ER-12345' with 5 digits [CASE009]`
- Error Location: `Engineering Req Number`

---

## 10) (Advanced) Case – Restrict Changes to Engineering Req After Close

Create a Case validation rule that prevents changing the **Engineering Req Number** after the Case is already **Closed**.

- Object: Case
- Field: Status (`Status`)
- Field: Engineering Req Number (`EngineeringReqNumber__c`)
- Rule Name: `CASE010_EngReq_No_Change_After_Close`
- Description: Block updates to Engineering Req Number once the Case has been closed.
- Requirement:

  - If `Status = "Closed"` and `EngineeringReqNumber__c` has changed compared to its prior value, the save should be blocked.

- Hint: Use `ISPICKVAL`, `ISCHANGED`, and/or `PRIORVALUE`.
- Error Message: `Engineering Req Number cannot be modified after the Case is Closed [CASE010]`
- Error Location: `Engineering Req Number`
