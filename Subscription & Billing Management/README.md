# Steps to Create a Subscription Billing & Management System in Salesforce

### **Objective:**

Build a Subscription Billing and Management System to handle subscription plans, customers, invoices, and payments efficiently. The system should automate billing cycles, calculate taxes, and provide reports.

## **Step 1: Define Objects and Relationships**

1. **Custom Objects:**

   - **Subscription Plans**: To store details of subscription tiers.
   - **Customers**: To store customer information.
   - **Subscriptions**: To manage active subscriptions.
   - **Invoices**: To record billing information.
   - **Payments**: To track payments.

2. **Relationships:**

   - **Subscription Plans** (Parent) -> **Subscriptions** (Child) [Lookup or Master-Detail].
   - **Customers** (Parent) -> **Subscriptions** (Child) [Lookup].
   - **Invoices** (Parent) -> **Payments** (Child) [Master-Detail].

3. **Fields for Each Object:**

   - **Subscription Plans:**
     - Plan Name (Text)
     - Price (Currency)
     - Billing Cycle (Picklist: Monthly, Annual)
     - Features (Long Text Area)
   - **Customers:**
     - Name (Text)
     - Email (Email)
     - Phone (Phone)
     - Address (Text Area)
   - **Subscriptions:**
     - Subscription Start Date (Date)
     - Subscription End Date (Date)
     - Status (Picklist: Active, Paused, Cancelled)
     - Plan (Lookup to Subscription Plans)
     - Customer (Lookup to Customers)
   - **Invoices:**
     - Invoice Number (Auto-Number)
     - Amount (Formula: Based on Subscription Plan Price)
     - Due Date (Date)
     - Status (Picklist: Paid, Pending, Overdue)
     - Subscription (Lookup to Subscriptions)
   - **Payments:**
     - Payment Date (Date)
     - Amount (Currency)
     - Method (Picklist: Credit Card, Bank Transfer, PayPal)
     - Invoice (Master-Detail to Invoices)

---

## **Step 2: Automate Business Processes**

1. **Validation Rules:**

   - Ensure all required fields (e.g., Plan, Start Date) are filled.
   - Prevent a Subscription from being marked "Active" without a valid Plan.
   - Prevent overdue Invoices from being associated with Payments exceeding the due amount.

2. **Formula Fields:**

   - **Invoices:**
     - Total Amount = Subscription Plan Price + Taxes (if applicable).
     - Taxes = (Subscription Plan Price \* Tax Rate%).
   - **Subscriptions:**
     - Calculate the End Date based on Start Date and Billing Cycle.

3. **Workflows/Flows:**

   - **Generate Invoices:**
     - Use Scheduled Flows to create an Invoice when a Subscription is activated or at the start of a new billing cycle.
   - **Send Invoice Emails:**
     - Automate invoice reminders with Lightning Email Templates.
   - **Update Subscription Status:**
     - Use Flows to mark Subscriptions as "Cancelled" if payment is overdue for 30 days.

## **Step 3: Security and Access Management**

1. **Profiles and Permission Sets:**

   - Admin Profile: Full access to all objects and fields.
   - Billing Team Profile: Access to Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payments.
   - Customer Service Profile: Access to Customers and Subscriptions.

2. **Field-Level Security:**

   - Restrict sensitive fields like Payment Details from unauthorized users.

3. **Sharing Rules:**

   - Grant access to specific Subscriptions based on regional teams.

---

## **Step 4: UI Customizations**

1. **Page Layouts:**

   - Design separate layouts for different user profiles.
   - Add related lists (e.g., Invoices under Subscriptions).

2. **Dynamic Forms:**

   - Use Dynamic Forms for Customers to display subscription details based on customer type (e.g., Business vs. Individual).

3. **Global Actions:**

   - Create actions for quick invoice generation, subscription cancellations, and payment logging.

4. **Custom Tabs:**

   - Create tabs for easy access to Subscription Plans, Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payments.

---

## **Step 5: Analytics and Reporting**

1. **Dashboards:**

   - Total Revenue (Sum of all payments).
   - Active vs. Cancelled Subscriptions.
   - Overdue Invoices.

2. **Reports:**

   - Monthly Revenue Report.
   - Subscription Trends by Plan.
   - Customer Churn Rate.

---

## **Step 6: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Test Cases:**

   - Ensure Invoices are generated correctly.
   - Validate payment logging and status updates.
   - Test flows for subscription status changes.

2. **User Training:**

   - Train users on how to use the system effectively.

3. **Deployment:**

   - Deploy the system in production using change sets or Salesforce DevOps tools.
   - Monitor for issues post-deployment.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a fully functional and automated Subscription Billing & Management System that enhances business processes and delivers real value.
