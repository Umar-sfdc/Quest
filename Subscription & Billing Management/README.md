# Steps to Create a Complex Subscription Billing & Management System in Salesforce

### **Objective:**

Build a robust Subscription Billing and Management System to handle subscription plans, customers, invoices, and payments with advanced features like tiered pricing, tax calculations, and detailed analytics. This system should automate billing cycles, support integrations, and ensure data security.

## **Step 1: Define Objects and Relationships**

1. **Custom Objects:**

   - **Subscription Plans**: Stores subscription tiers with advanced pricing and feature rules.
   - **Customers**: Stores detailed customer data, including regional preferences and payment history.
   - **Subscriptions**: Manages active subscriptions and tracks lifecycle.
   - **Invoices**: Records billing information with tax and discount details.
   - **Payments**: Tracks multi-method payments and reconciliation.

2. **Relationships:**

   - **Subscription Plans** (Parent) -> **Subscriptions** (Child) [Master-Detail].
   - **Customers** (Parent) -> **Subscriptions** (Child) [Lookup].
   - **Invoices** (Parent) -> **Payments** (Child) [Master-Detail].

3. **Fields for Each Object:**

   - **Subscription Plans:**

   - Plan Name (Text)

   - Price (Currency)

   - Tiered Pricing (Picklist: Standard, Premium, Enterprise)

   - Billing Cycle (Picklist: Monthly, Annual, Custom)

   - Features (Rich Text Area)

   - Maximum Users (Number)

   - Applicable Regions (Multi-Select Picklist)

     - Phone (Phone)
     - Address (Long Text Area)
     - Customer Type (Picklist: Individual, Business)
     - Preferred Payment Method (Picklist: Credit Card, ACH, PayPal)
     - Region (Picklist)
     - Total Spend (Formula: SUM of Payments)

     - Subscription End Date (Formula: Based on Start Date and Billing Cycle)
     - Status (Picklist: Active, Paused, Cancelled, Expired)
     - Plan (Lookup to Subscription Plans)

     - Renewal Status (Picklist: Auto-Renew, Manual Renewal)
     - Last Invoice Date (Date)

   - **Invoices:**

     - Invoice Number (Auto-Number)
     - Amount (Formula: Base Price + Tax - Discount)
     - Tax Amount (Formula: Amount \* Tax Rate%)
     - Discount (Percent or Currency)
     - Due Date (Date)
     - Status (Picklist: Paid, Pending, Overdue)
     - Subscription (Lookup to Subscriptions)

   - **Payments:**

     - Payment Date (Date)

     - Payment Method (Picklist: Credit Card, ACH, Bank Transfer, PayPal)
     - Reconciliation Status (Picklist: Reconciled, Unreconciled)

## **Step 2: Automate Business Processes**

1. **Validation Rules:**

   - Ensure required fields like Plan, Start Date, and Renewal Status are completed.
   - Prevent activating Subscriptions without valid Customer and Plan associations.
   - Restrict duplicate Invoices for the same Subscription within the same billing cycle.

2. **Formula Fields:**

   - **Invoices:**
     - Total Amount = (Subscription Plan Price \* Number of Users) + Taxes â€“ Discounts.
     - Taxes = (Subscription Plan Price \* Tax Rate%) \* Applicable Region.
   - **Subscriptions:**
     - End Date = Start Date + (Billing Cycle Months).
     - Next Billing Date = End Date + Grace Period.

3. **Workflows/Flows:**

   - **Invoice Generation:**
     - Scheduled Flows to auto-generate Invoices at the start of a billing cycle.
   - **Payment Follow-Up:**
     - Notify Customers of overdue payments with Lightning Email Templates.
   - **Subscription Lifecycle Management:**
     - Automatically update Subscription Status to "Expired" after the End Date.

4. **Scheduled Jobs:**

   - Use Apex or Flows to check and send reminders for upcoming renewals.

## **Step 3: Security and Access Management**

1. **Profiles and Permission Sets:**

   - Admin Profile: Full access to objects, flows, and analytics.
   - Billing Team Profile: Access to manage Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payments.
   - Customer Service Profile: Restricted to Customers and Subscription Details.

2. **Field-Level Security:**

   - Hide sensitive fields like Payment Method or Reconciliation Status from unauthorized users.

3. **Sharing Rules:**

   - Grant access based on geographic region or account manager responsibility.

---

## **Step 4: UI Customizations**

1. **Page Layouts:**

   - Separate layouts for admin, billing, and customer service users.
   - Add related lists like Subscriptions under Customers.

2. **Dynamic Forms:**

   - Display Tiered Pricing and Applicable Regions dynamically based on Plan Type.

3. **Global Actions:**

   - Quick actions for adding Payments, Cancelling Subscriptions, or Generating Invoices.

4. **Custom Tabs:**

   - Create tabs for direct access to Customers, Plans, Subscriptions, and Payments.

---

## **Step 5: Analytics and Reporting**

1. **Dashboards:**

   - Monthly Revenue (by Region, Plan, and Customer Type).
   - Subscription Trends (Active, Paused, Expired).
   - Payment Reconciliation Status (Reconciled vs. Unreconciled).

2. **Reports:**

   - Customer Retention and Churn Rate.
   - Tax Collected by Region.
   - Overdue Invoices and Revenue Impact.

---

## **Step 6: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Test Cases:**

   - Verify Invoices are generated accurately for different Billing Cycles and Tiered Pricing.
   - Test Payments and ensure Reconciliation updates statuses correctly.
   - Check Flows and Automation for Subscription Expirations.

2. **User Training:**

   - Provide training for users to handle Payments, Customer Support, and Billing Analytics.

3. **Deployment:**

   - Use DevOps or Change Sets to deploy from Sandbox to Production.
   - Conduct post-deployment audits for accuracy.

By implementing these advanced steps, your Subscription Billing & Management System will deliver enterprise-level functionality, improve operational efficiency, and ensure robust financial management.
